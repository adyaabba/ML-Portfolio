# Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my ML portfolio! This repository showcases projects from my journey in machine learning, ranging from neural networks and image recognition to sequence modeling and dimensionality reduction.

With a background in Physics, Iâ€™m expanding my skills by combining machine learning with quantum computing. You can explore my quantum computing projects [here](https://github.com/adyaabba/quantum-computing-portfolio), where I apply ML techniques in a quantum context to tackle complex problems.

## Projects

### 5.Sequence Modeling (RNN, LSTM)
- **Description**: Built and trained RNNs and LSTMs for sequence-based tasks.

### 6. Mini Project
- **Description**: Developed ML models (CNN, Conv1D, RNN) for neutrino event detection in CRES data, optimizing predictions with feature engineering and statistical analysis. Achieved RMSE of 0.122 ms (start times) and 0.489 MHz (start frequencies) using Python (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib).
