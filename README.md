# Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my ML portfolio! This repository showcases projects from my journey in machine learning, ranging from neural networks and image recognition to sequence modeling and dimensionality reduction.

With a background in Physics, Iâ€™m expanding my skills by combining machine learning with quantum computing. You can explore my quantum computing projects [here](https://github.com/adyaabba/quantum-computing-portfolio), where I apply ML techniques in a quantum context to tackle complex problems.

## Projects
