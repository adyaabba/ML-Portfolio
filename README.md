# Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my ML portfolio! This repository showcases projects from my journey in machine learning, ranging from neural networks and image recognition to sequence modeling and dimensionality reduction.

With a background in Physics, Iâ€™m expanding my skills by combining machine learning with quantum computing. You can explore my quantum computing projects [here](https://github.com/adyaabba/quantum-computing-portfolio), where I apply ML techniques in a quantum context to tackle complex problems.

## Projects

### 1. Training Neural Networks

- **Description**: Basics of training neural networks.
- Files: `polynomial_model_sgd.ipynb`

### 2. Image Compression & Recognition with Keras

- **Description**: Implemented image compression and recognition using Keras.
- Files: `MNIST_Noise_Training_2.ipynb`

### 3. CNNs & Autoencoders
- **Description**: Working with convolutional neural networks and autoencoders.

### 4. Unsupervised Learning (PCA, t-SNE)
Applied PCA and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction and data visualization.

### 5.Sequence Modeling (RNN, LSTM)
- **Description**: Built and trained RNNs and LSTMs for sequence-based tasks.

### 6. Mini Project
- **Description**: A personal project integrating the techniques learned across the course.
